This project studies air quality data to find patterns and relationships between different factors like pollution, temperature, and wind speed. The data includes measurements of gases like carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NOâ‚‚), as well as weather conditions like humidity and temperature. The goal is to understand how these factors are connected and if there are any unusual changes in the data. The project uses Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib to clean the data, make charts, and find useful information. The results can help us learn more about air pollution and how it changes with the weather.
